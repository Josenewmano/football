A project in Java to generate an application to provide football stats. With a UML-first developmental model, there are no tests. The brief was as follows:

"The English football system is a mess! And our new client wants to launch a new app to visualise the results of the different professional leagues in UK. It is your time to start working on this.

The app should handle each week matches for every team, and every league, taking its basic statistics (score, who scored, minute for each goal, yellow cards, and red cards), and lineups.

The system shall return printed in the console a results table for each league. Given a pair of teams, the system shall return the details for the match printed on console."
